### Hi, my name is Ilia, and I'm a certified front-end developer with an advanced skillset.

## Please reach out if you are interested in web app development.

#### In my repos you can find code examples from the projects I had been working on.

_My personal recommendation is to check the side project I work on in my free time._\
Which is a PWA to track your activity and plan your day in a clean and minimal aesthetic.
